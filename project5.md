This was my first drawing for Mrs. Malm's class. We needed to used the value in the charcol in order to make the object alife with the help of shadows, highlights and right proportions. The corrections Mrs. gave me were that I needed to draw the table where the bottle it's placed because that would make the bottle more realistic.
