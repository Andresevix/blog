title: The Wine Bottle
---
 
_Looks fine to me._

  In the observational drawing class we first learned all the terminology in order to actually understand what Mrs. Malm was talking about.  Once we were done with that, we proceeded to learn some techniques that would improve our drawing skills. At the end of the class Mrs. Malm started drawing the wine bottle while explaning step by step, I was amaze on Mrs. Malm's way of making everything look so simple. Then suddenly the wine bottle appears in the block. 

 Couple days later I began my assiment. Everything was going fine, taking the mesureaments, straigth lines, realistic shadows, etc. Now I'm really happy with my work. Hoping that Ms. Malm thinks the same.
