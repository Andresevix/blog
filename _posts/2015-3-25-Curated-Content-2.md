According to Forbes, The brand value of Nike in 2014 is estimated to be at $19 billion, up from $17.3 billion last year making it 'The World's Most Valuable Sports Brands 2014'. 

"Nike commands 62% of the US athletic footwear market, including the Jordan brand, and its market share rose 100 basis points in August," Forbes said. 

Is no surprise that Nike is a huge force in the athletic world but such large numbers can impresse anybody and he's closer competitor is Adidas with only 7.2 billions.
