title:  The Secret of Make a Perfect Negative Space Drawing.
---

Negative Space, in art of course, is the space around and between an object. In order to make the perfect negative space drawing you'll have to imagine the object your drawing in a black background and then cutting out the object. Imagining the object  being 2D can help a lot to focus only on the silhouette of such object. The sharper you make the edges the better understanding the drawing will have. Also, the object need some source of complexity in order to understand the drawing without telling the viewer what is it, as weird it may sound. Getting proportions right is a big part of negative space. 


Here are some examples:
