title: Rising sea levels threaten South Florida? Scary movie becomes reality.
---

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — On a recent afternoon, Scott McKenzie watched torrential rains and a murky tide swallow the street outside his dog-grooming salon. Within minutes, much of this stretch of chic South Beach was flooded ankle-deep in a fetid mix of rain and sea.
There are few places in the nation more vulnerable to rising sea levels than low-lying *South Florida*, a tourist and retirement mecca built on drained swampland.
Yet as other coastal states and the Obama administration takes aggressive measures to battle the effects of global warming, Florida’s top Republican politicians are challenging the science and balking at government fixes.
Gov. Rick Scott, has worked with the Republican-controlled Legislature to dismantle Florida’s fledgling climate change initiatives.
•	“I’m not a scientist,” Scott said, after a federal report pinpointed Florida – and Miami in particular – as among the country’s most at-risk areas.

•	Democrats plan to place climate change, and the GOP’s skepticism, front and center in a state where the issue is no longer an abstraction.
Their hope is to win over independents and siphon some Republicans, who are deeply divided over global warming. 
*Tom Steyer*, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend *$100 million* this year to influence seven critical contests nationwide, including the Florida governor’s race.
The battle in the country’s largest swing state offers a preview of what could be a pivotal fight in the next presidential election.
•	Crist is running for his old job as a Democrat, criticizing Scott and Florida Republicans for reversing his efforts to curb global warming.
•	“They don’t believe in science. That’s ridiculous,” Crist said at a recent campaign rally in Miami. “This is ground zero for climate change in America.”
Polls show a bipartisan majority of Americans favor measures to *reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases*, such as the new federal rule to limit carbon emissions from power plants. But they routinely rank climate change far behind the economy, the centerpiece of Scott’s campaign, when prioritizing issues.
In *Miami Beach*, which floods even on sunny days, the concern is palpable. On a recent afternoon, McKenzie pulled out his iPad and flipped through photos from a 2009 storm. In one, two women kayak through knee-high water in the center of town.
•	“This is not a future problem. It’s a current problem,” said Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University and a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century.
Miami Beach is expected to spend *$400 million* on an elaborate pumping system to cope with routine flooding. 
To the north, Fort Lauderdale has shelled out millions to restore beaches and a section of coastal highway after Hurricane Sandy and other storms breached the city’s concrete sea wall. Hallandale Beach, which lies on the Atlantic Coast between the two cities, has abandoned six of its eight drinking water wells because of encroaching seawater.
•	“It’s getting to the point where some properties being bought today will probably not be able to be sold at the end of a 30-year mortgage,” said Harold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at University of Miami. “You would think responsible leaders and responsible governments would take that as a wake-up call.”

•	Florida lacks a statewide approach to the effects of climate change, although just a few years ago, it was at the forefront on the issue.


•	In 2007, Crist, then a Republican, declared global warming *“one of the most important issues that we will face this century,”* signed executive orders to tighten tailpipe-emission standards for cars and opposed coal-fired power plants.
Meanwhile, Miami Beach is bracing for another season of punishing tides.
*“We’re suffering while everyone is arguing man-made or natural,”* said Christine Florez, president of the West Avenue Corridor Neighborhood Association. *“We should be working together to find solutions so people don’t feel like they’ve been left on a log drifting out to sea.”*
