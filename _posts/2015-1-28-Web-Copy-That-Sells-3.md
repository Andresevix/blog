In chapter 2 the author wrote on how to increase your actual sells of your product, why such products fail to sell and how important is to ask yourself the three P's. What are those three P's you may ask?
Well, this three P's stands for **P**ain, **P**roblem, or **P**redicament. This three words are the one's to define you as a great copywriter as long as you can identify them properly.
A way to identify properly these P's first you have to ask yourself "What's the problem?". Once you recognize the problem the next question is why hasn't the problem been solved?
What can you do to fix the problem? What is possible? As the chapter said. What makes your product unique? That make it stand out from competitors. Use that difference in your advantage. 
Once you have all of those questions answer now there's only one left: What should you do? 

There you go. You have successfully create a blueprint for your comercial website.
