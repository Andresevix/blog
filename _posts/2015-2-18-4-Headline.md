---
Here are some small tips that can improve your outcome from working out: 

* Limit your workout to 30 or 40 min but make them intensive. It's complete false that you need to workout at least 1 hour a day.
* Protein. Protein. Protein. Many people make the mistake of not worrying about feeding their muscles after a workout session a protein is just what your muscle needs.
* Drink tons of water. A well hydrated body is a healthy body.
* Slow lifting is the best way to gain muscle, by doing this you are maximizing every move you make.
* Mix it up. Please don't have the same routine for every day, every muscle needs exercise.
