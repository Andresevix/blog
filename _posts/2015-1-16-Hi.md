title: Missed first class
---
 
I lost my first class of Fundaments of Design.

On Tuesday I went to my first day of college, to see my first class with Mrs. Malm which is Observational drawing. Mrs. Malm asked for our yellow sheets and I forgot mine at home so I went down to get it print one again. They told me a got a Hold which doesn't make any sense because it is my first quarter. Even Vanessa, the lady from files, was confused.
When they gave me the schedule I didn't look at it because i thought a was late for Mrs. Malm class.  One hour later Mrs. Malm ended im making my way up stairs to the classroom were Mr. Carson class was supposed to happen 
according to my first schedule. What end up happing was that a lost my first class of Mr. Carson which I was really exited about.
