title: Attended Second Class
---

Just got home from the university. My first impression of Mr. Carson is that we're going to have lots of fun at his class.
I sat at the big table in the middle with some people i'd seen before. The class was basically to do the homework which is 4 collages
with a meaning, not just "pretty pictures". I got 2 done but I'm stock with the last two. We'll see how it goes.
