title: Being Creative
---


I've always been obsessed with arranging my own room, making "cool" drawings on assignments that didn't require doodles. I even took my father's camera around the house just to see what interesting pictures I could get. 

For me, being creative was always a must. I could never understand why people want to act the same as others because it was the status quo. I grew up in a pretty diverse family; my dad is a lawyer with an interior design dream, my uncle is a surfer and now is a publisher, my cousin had his own punk-ska band, and even my grandfather, who I never got the chance to meet unfortunately, was a poet and a famous politician back in the day. My mom thought he was a pretty funny guy. 

Design and visuals constantly get my attention; I spend hours making random designs for t-shirts in my math class with some friends who like designing as much as me. School teachers were indeed a huge part of my decision toward becoming a graphic designer. I loved the art class and even more, the technical drawing. At a pretty young age I knew I would do something involving the arts. At the moment, graphic design is the perfect pick for me. I'm still very much open to other career possibilities that teachers might suggest, since I've noticed at MIU many teachers question our career decisions in a good way, to make sure we do what we love and what we're good at.
