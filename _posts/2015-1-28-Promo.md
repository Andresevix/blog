Title: Chapter 1
---
Chapter one is all about, as the title implies it, getting stared in how to sell or promote something even yourself on the web and of course the dynamics behind this.
In this chapter the author wrote about the 3 mayor rules of web selling which are: 

<ul>
<li>Donâ€™t Make Your Website Look Like an Ad.</li>
<li>Stop Readers Dead in Their Tracks.</li>
<li>Capture E-Mail Addresses.</li>
</ul>

The first rule it's key in order to accomplish a successful website where not only people would stay on for a certain period of time but also to make _real_ to the viewer in this case. 
Proviring the exact information the costumers are looking for is huge since people go online to seek for information. 
The second rule is important aswell beacuse you don't want your readers to feel that they're only reading an ad. Put some excitment in the titles!
Emotion and drama are two things people love so just give them what tehy love.
The third rule is the whole porpuse of making your website, connecting with people, giving them more information, recieve constructive criticism, etc. 
As the owner of a web selling site you want people to give you feedback and by having their e-mails you're able to ask for advice. All of this to make your website bigger and better.
