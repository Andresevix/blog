Studying photography is a career which is growing incredibly rapidly. But everybody must start from the basics. 
Here are some tips to take great pictures:

* Pay attention to your background. You don't want a noise background when taking a portrait, the less distraction the background bring to the main subject of your photo the better.
* Don't be afraid of taking vertical photos, they actually tend to be more pleasant and interesting.
* Move in close, make your subject the only element in the photography to bring out every detail that can be translate in a history.
* Don't centralize your photos, please. Nobody wants a carnet photo.
* Make sure your main subject is in perfect focus. A sharp background with a blurry face might not be ideal.


Hopefully these tips will get you more likes on your Instagram. Have fun!
