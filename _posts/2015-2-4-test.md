######Having problems making the right connections?

As a graphic designer it could be hard to get in the business itself if you don't have the right connections, most graphic designer don't reach the dream job because of their lacking social skills and that comes with confidence. The first step to become a freelance graphic designer is to have your website where possible bosses can see your work, basically your portfolio. If your portfolio seems like an old website for an ad and that ad is yourself, no one will be interest. A great looking website is a most a graphic designer and will make your visitors attention span bigger. 

Don't over saturated your website with irrelevant text, especially as a designer. Remember that people on the internet don't read, they _scan_. Showing your work with a small and sweet explanation is more than enough. If you keep the information short and to the point the visitors to your page will love you. 

Another important aspect to improve your connections and be more approachable is to gather the emails of your visitors, to let them know of a new work, promotors, projects, basically any update to your website. That way the traffic of your site will increase and therefore more opportunities.
