  We graphic designer, artists and content creators already know how important is to get your work out there for several reasons, either trying to get a job or just to be apart of a community that can inspire you. We use various sites trying to achieve that experience and to get people to see your work because with criticism everything can improve. 
By knowing which website is the best for uploading your more recent work and getting comments, views, etc. We’ll save the average student, content creator or artist the time and negative experience by doing the research and getting all the facts together. 

  Now, let’s see what are the top sites.
