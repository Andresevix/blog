title: Been Creative
---


I've always been obsessed with arranging my own room, making "cool" drawings in assignments that didn't required doodles, even taking my father's camera around the house just to see what interesting pictures I could get. 

For me been creative was always a most. I could never understand why people want to act the same as others because it was the status quote. I grew up in a pretty diverse family, my dad as a lawyer which a interior design dream, an uncle was a surfer and now is a publisher, a cousin who had his own punk-ska band and even my grandfather, who I never got the chance to met unfortunately, has a poet and a famous politician back in the days. Also a pretty funny guy according to my mom. 

Design and visual constantly got my attention, spend hours making random design for t-shirts in the math class with some friends who liked designing as much as me. School teachers were indeed a huge part of my decision behind graphic design. I loved the art class and even more the technical drawing. At a pretty young age I knew I have to do something involve in arts. Graphic Design is the perfect pick according to me at the moment. I'm still very much open to other possibilities that teacher, since I've noticed that in MIU every teacher question you're career decision in a good way, to make sure you do what you love and what you're good at.
