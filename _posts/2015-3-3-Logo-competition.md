  I’m wondering if you’ll sign up to the competition since you're an artist, or not. The prize may blow you away. 

  *MIU* is creating this amazing opportunity to make the students work together, get to know each other and improve ideas that they may 
already had. Who knows? Maybe you find "the one"... The university is looking for an alternative logo to put in billboards, ads, etc. and they're looking for designer in the university.
I'm pretty sure every student in MIU is capable of winning this contest, *easily*. Now that you're reading this post, read
the contest regulation in order to win:

*You have to be a MIU student.
*Your Logo have to incorporate the University logo.
*Logo must be summited in the PDF format, color and black and white.
*Due date for the logo is *3/20/2015*.

  The prize, besides the fact that design will be seen by millions which it's already surprisingly good, it's *$400* cash and a trip to our school in 
*San Francisco!* 

  *Get your design on and have fun!*
