![Leaving Heaven](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7422/16198029967_080c595c10_c.jpg)
 
Fourth collage i did. I wanted to expressed that in my opinion religion is losing the importance that once it had. The angels are leaving heaven with paper bags on their heads because "they are not famuos anymore". The crowd at the bottom represents the good time and how not caring about religion could actually open up your mind and start enjoying life at it's fullest.
